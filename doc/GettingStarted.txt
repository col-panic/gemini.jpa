Getting Started with Gemini JPA 
--------------------------------

Gemini JPA implements the OSGi JPA specification. It uses EclipseLink as the JPA provider.

Required Bundles
----------------

To run Gemini JPA in OSGi you will need to have the following:

1. OSGi Framework

You may use Plugin Development Environment (PDE) in Eclipse, which will give you access to the Equinox 
OSGi framework, or you may execute outside of PDE and use any OSGi framework you choose, such as Felix. 
Weaving of entity classes is only supported on Equinox, but weaving is strictly an optimization and is 
not needed for JPA operation. 

2. OSGi Enterprise API bundle

Gemini JPA implements some of the OSGi Enterprise APIs so the osgi.enterprise bundle must be resident. 
The bundle includes both the source and the class files so it can be used for both execution and debugging.
The Gemini DBAccess download includes this bundle as part of its download, or it can be downloaded from
the OSGi web site: http://www.osgi.org/Download/Release4V42

3. Gemini DBAccess (Optional)

While you don't strictly require Gemini DBAccess to run Gemini JPA it renders your application much more
modular and easier to configure. The actual bundles you need depend upon the database you are using. 
If DBAccess is not present you will need to make the JDBC driver accessible to the EclipseLink bundles.

4. EclipseLink bundles

The following EclipseLink bundles are required:

- javax.persistence
- org.eclipse.persistence.asm
- org.eclipse.persistence.antlr
- org.eclipse.persistence.core
- org.eclipse.persistence.jpa

These bundles must be version 2.2 or greater. 

Note: You do *NOT* need the org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.osgi bundle shipped with EclipseLink.

5. Gemini JPA bundles

There are two bundles shipped with Gemini JPA:

- org.elipse.gemini.jpa - the Gemini supporting classes
- org.elipse.gemini.jpa.weaving - weaving support for Gemini JPA

Installation
------------

If running in PDE then unzip the files into a directory and import the various projects into your workspace.
If you are using the framework directly then unzip the distribution files and follow the documentation of
the framework for installing the bundles in the order specified above.

Configuration
-------------

Gemini JPA does not require any special environment configuration.
